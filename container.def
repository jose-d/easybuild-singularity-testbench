Bootstrap: shub
From: singularityhub/centos:latest


# we could bootstrap from library too, but in comparison with shub it's too slow:
#BootStrap: library
#From: library://library/default/centos

    # update centos, setup epel and install tools we need to install tools:
    yum -y install yum-utils epel-release yum-plugin-versionlock curl

    # install our OFED repo:

    curl ${ofed_repo_file} > /etc/yum.repos.d/ofed.repo	#install OFED repo

    # update OS
    # - update of setup would break the things. IDN why.

    yum -y update -x setup

    # on top of latest OS + EPEL, install OHPC repo

    yum -y install https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/releases/download/v1.3.GA/ohpc-release-1.3-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

    # .. and install all the well known tools and libs we like, including compute-node part of ohpc:

    yum -y install ohpc-base-compute lmod-ohpc EasyBuild-ohpc GitPython pysvn graphviz vim zlib-devel libyaml-devel gdbm-devel readline-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel curl git redis libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libcurl-devel libicu-devel python libuuid-devel wget waf less openssl openssl-devel openssl-libs tree strace expect

    # slurm client can be useful for some tests..:

    yum -y install slurm-ohpc

    # distro build toolchain

    yum -y groupinstall "Development tools"

    # Install FPM as it is dependency of most manual/documentation builds

    yum -y install ruby-devel gcc make rpm-build rubygems	# ruby env and its deps
    gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc fpm				# fpm itself

    # man(ual)-related deps:

    yum -y install asciidoc xmlto man-db

    # ofed components
    # - it dependency of foss20XX-X

    yum -y install rdma-core-devel	#deps of foss2018b

    # deps of Mathematica

    yum -y install alsa-lib

    # latest EB:
    # - perhaps current OHPC is not using latest easybuild. So let's use build-in self-update feature of easybuild,
    #   and install (when needed) latest easybuild into /opt/eb. If we have latest EB, this will not do anything

    mkdir -p /sw/local/el7/x86_64
    mkdir -p /opt/eb && chmod -R 777 /opt/eb	# here we'll install the latest easybuild
    useradd eb	# local eb user as eb doesn't like root
    su eb -c "export EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH=/dev/shm && export EASYBUILD_MODULES_TOOL=Lmod && export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=/opt/eb && source /etc/profile.d/lmod.sh && module load EasyBuild && eb --install-latest-eb-release"
